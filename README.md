# Springboard Capstone Project 2: Predicting NHL Playoff Teams #
===========================================

The aim of this project is to predict which NHL teams will make 
the playoffs in a given year based only on their opening day
roster and those players' prior-season statistics. The model 
beat most pundits with 12/16 correct predictions for 2022-23. 

Time will tell how it does for 2023-24.
