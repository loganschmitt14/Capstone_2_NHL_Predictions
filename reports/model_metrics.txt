Model Metrics:

Ensemble Model Aggregates Predictions from 3 Regressors:

* Linear Regressor
	- No parameters
	- 74.93% weighted mean accuracy on training data
	- 8.60% accuracy standard deviation on training data
	- 62.5% accuracy on holdout data (2023)

* Support Vector Regressor
	- SVR(kernel = 'rbf', gamma = 'scale', epsilon = 0.05)
	- 69.22% weighted mean accuracy on training data
	- 7.57% accuracy standard deviation on training data
	- 75% accuracy on holdout data (2023)

* LightGBM Regressor
	- LGBMRegressor(boosting_type = 'dart', num_leaves = 12, max_depth = 16, random_state = 14,
		 min_data_in_leaf = 16, verbosity = -1, force_col_wise = True)
	- 72.53% weighted mean accuracy on training data
	- 9.03% accuracy standard deviation
	- 75% accuracy on holdout data (2023)

Process: 

* Each model is trained on X_all, y_all

* Each model predicts on X_24

* Each prediction vector is scaled with StandardScaler()

* Prediction vectors are averaged

* Averaged predictions are used to create playoff team predictions

Results:

Ensemble Model correctly predicted 12/16 (75%) of playoff teams for holdout year (2023)
